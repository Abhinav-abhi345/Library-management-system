# Library-management-system
Creates three static inner classes: Book, which holds details like ID, title, author, and issue status; User, which stores a user's ID, name, and the list of books they've issued; and Library, which manages a collection of books and users. The library provides methods to add books and users, issue books to users (if available), return books, and display the current status of all books and users. In the main method, sample books and users are added, books are issued and returned, and the results are displayed, demonstrating how the classes interact to simulate basic library operations.
